# 🎮 Game Arena
## Java Console Multi-Game Project

Game Arena is a Java console application that combines multiple classic games into one program. It was built to practice core Java concepts such as arrays, file handling, loops, exception handling, and game logic.

The entire project runs in the terminal without graphics libraries, focusing on logic, structure, and clean program flow.

## Project Overview

Game Arena works like a small arcade menu. The user chooses a game, plays it, and can replay or return to the main menu.
Each game focuses on different programming skills, including problem solving, state tracking, and user input validation.

Key features:

- Menu-driven interface
- Replayable game loops
- Input validation
- File-based word storage
- Score tracking
- Randomized gameplay

## Games Included

### Hangman
A word guessing game with ASCII graphics.

- Random words loaded from file
- Hangman drawing that updates after wrong guesses
- Tracks guessed letters
- Saves final score to a record file

### Memory Match
A tile matching puzzle using emoji pairs.

- User chooses grid size
- Randomized emoji board
- Matching logic
- Score based on number of mistakes

### Word Scramble
A timed word puzzle.

- Difficulty levels (easy / medium / hard)
- Category selection
- Random word scrambling
- Time-based scoring

### Tic Tac Toe
Classic strategy game.

- Multiplayer mode
- Player vs computer mode
- Computer AI blocks and wins when possible
- Replay support

## Concepts Used

This project demonstrates:

- 2D arrays
- File input/output
- Exception handling
- Random number generation
- Game loops
- State management
- Basic AI logic
- Console UI formatting

Everything is built using core Java only.

## How to Run
Compile and run GameArena.java.
Make sure all text files are in the same folder.

## Project Structure
GameArena.java + word files must stay in the same directory.

## Learning Goals

This project helped me practice:

- Logical problem solving
- Structured programming
- Defensive input handling
- File persistence
- Game design in Java
- Writing reusable methods

Each game focuses on a different programming challenge.
